# Decision Tree

## Usage
 To construct decision tree, simply run `python decision_tree.py`.

 This will not create the GraphViz decision tree pdf as this is not installed on CS lab
 servers. To do so, run both 'pip install graphviz' and 'sudo apt-get install graphviz'.
 Then change set 'create_graphviz=True' in `decision_tree.py:main()`.

## Dependencies
Required non-standard python libraries
  * numpy
  * graphviz (Alternatively, can plot Graphs at http://webgraphviz.com/)
